I am thinking about a device or perhaps a mobile app that would allow someone to take a photo of the animal and the app be able to detect what type of animal or species the animal is. This would be a great technology idea for people who are interested in identifying animals, or hunters who are trying to identify what type of deer or animal they are hunting. They could take a picture of it, upload it to the app, and have the app identify what exactly the animal is, what it's species is, where it usually lives, etc."},{"id":"http://purl.org/innovonto/ideas/cd6fd890-a2a8-4797-a031-4fcf2fa887c5","content":"It could be useful for survivalists."},{"id":"http://purl.org/innovonto/ideas/cdc43075-df0e-40e8-85b9-13c390a50814","content":"I could see where people are in different parts of my home."},{"id":"http://purl.org/innovonto/ideas/ce0c1da1-641e-4668-9a9b-d08392693b72","content":"It could be used for hunting and fishing."},{"id":"http://purl.org/innovonto/ideas/cf65b021-620f-43fe-9473-1712be788cde","content":"This can enable me to interact and see where others are in my home."},{"id":"http://purl.org/innovonto/ideas/d1b7786c-90bd-46ec-97e5-eca5156864c5","content":"Use in home security systems to detect unusual behaviors on their property."},{"id":"http://purl.org/innovonto/ideas/d2af1899-0f24-4cc6-92c4-3f5b69e7206c","content":"This could be used to recognize speeders on the highway and issue tickets to repeat offenders."},{"id":"http://purl.org/innovonto/ideas/d44f2467-2e64-48ac-9bf0-a91bced9cfe3","content":"A technology that might be useful would be something that can detect if a criminal has a weapon or not on them.

If there is a way to tell when someone is moving a certain way, maybe we can prevent an attack.
